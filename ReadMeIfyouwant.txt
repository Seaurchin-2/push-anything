Hello!
Welcome to my first github repository!

10:30 p.m. January 26th, 2020 now.

I bought a new external SSD last week,
so I created a new virtual memory,
and installed Manjaro Linux in there.
But I can't set the screen resolution so far.
Damn...

In South Korea, Corona calmed down a bit.
After I went to school, there are too many homeworks.
And the final exam is coming quickly,
also an admission of highschool which I really want to go is coming...

I became a High school student!
and I'll go to school next Tuesday.
I bought a C++ Prime Plus to learn C++, but,
because of preparing high school study,
I lost a little interest in programming...
(Still terrible English Grammar)
