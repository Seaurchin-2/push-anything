Hello!
Welcome to my first github repository!

10:30 p.m. January 26th, 2020 now.

I bought a new external SSD last week,
so I created a new virtual memory,
and installed Manjaro Linux in there.
But I can't set the screen resolution so far.
Damn...

In South Korea, Corona calmed down a bit.
After I went to school, there are too many homeworks.
And the final exam is coming quickly,
also an admission of highschool which I really want to go is coming...
혼란하다 혼란해
(Oh damn so terrible English skills dammmmnnnnnn)
